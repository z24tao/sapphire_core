Scenario 1:
    - Agent standing on an apple
    - Agent first time seeing apple
        - Agent creates apple type
        - Agent creates apple object
            - Attribute red, spherical, direction none
    - Agent allowed 5 actions
        - Move (up / down / left / right)
        - Eat

a change happened -> what caused it

turn ....
turn n - 1
    step forward
turn n
    observe apple moved closer

i want a change to happen -> how

is x good or bad?
    good & i dont have it -> get it:
        search for change in memory and matchNew(x)
            true -> find action that causes this
                found -> iterate preconditions
                    all satisfied -> iterate causations
                        favourable -> activate action
