i ate an apple
    Q: how do i know this action "ate" is associated with object "apple"
    A: for now we can hard code it, eating as an action interface references an object, which
        returns its visuals, we then match the visuals on an object and reference that object
        in the action, and that object type in the action type
    Q: how do i know this action cannot be done without the presence of an abstract apple
    A: again, hard code it, every action that requires an object, assume the action type requires
        the object type

too many concepts in mind -> need to collapse
